To get started with the Weather NestJS API, follow these steps:

Step 1: After downloading all the required files, open your terminal or editor and navigate to the project directory. 
Run the command "npm install" to install all the necessary modules. 
This will add all the required dependencies to your project.

Step 2: Before running the application, ensure that MongoDB is running locally on your machine. 
Create a MongoDB database named Weather-data and within it, create a collection named cities. 
Make sure to adjust the MONGO_URI in the .env file according to your database configuration.

Step 3: Once the setup is complete, return to your terminal or editor and run the command "npm run start:dev". 
This will start your Weather NestJS API project in development mode.

Now, your Weather NestJS API is up and running on "http://localhost:3000/api". 
You can start using it to fetch weather data for configured cities using the OpenWeather API.
